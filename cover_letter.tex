\lettersection{About Me}

Final year undergraduate \textbf{\textit{Bachelor of Science}} student at the \textbf{\textit{University of Melbourne}} pursuing major in \textbf{\textit{Computing and Software Systems}}. I have worked on various frameworks and programming languages with complete exposure to all the IT methodologies with persistent effort and dedication and have done some personal projects with one of my favourite languages, Python shifting between frontend and backend technologies of a \textit{Full Stack Development} scenario. I have enjoyed and excelled in \textit{Algorithms and Data Structures} class and wish to contribute my algorithmic thinking to the company.

%------------------------------------------------

\lettersection{Why Me?}

I have enclosed my CV to support my application. It shows that I would bring important skills to the position, including:

\begin{description}[font=$\bullet$~\normalfont\scshape\color{red!50!black}]
\item [Experience.] I have had the opportunity to work on some bootcamps, hackathons and mostly on personal projects.
\item [Skills.] I am comfortable on a range of programming languages and methodologies which includes Python, Java, SQL, React to name a few.
\item [Performance.] I have always had a passion for technology and especially coding. In August 2016 my coding team became \textit{7th} among top \textit{24} teams in the Victoria Collegiate Programming Competition \textit{4th} among my University peers).

\lettersection{Why Seek?}

Seek Australia has been the leading job search in the market for quite a while impacting lives of 6 billion people in Australia and they have been quite successful with their magic search algorithm, part of which I would like to learn and add input for enhancement of the job/training based searches. There has been a whole range of changes to their UI/UX and it seems that a lot of creative leaps have been made to their front and backend technologies which I am keen to learn more about.
